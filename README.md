## What is this
Search Algorithms Visualization is a basic react project that shows how linear
and binary search work upon an collection of values. While the algorithms
involved are basic it mostly served to help me learn and practice good
programming habits in a langauge that is still pretty new to me. 
## How can I help?
Feel free to download the project and run it yourself to better understand
React and the involved search algorithms. Feel free to make a pull request with
any changes that you would think improve the project.
# Getting it started
Make sure that you have the latest version of npm installed
`which npm > /dev/null || curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo
-E bash - && sudo apt install nodejs
sudo npm install npm@latest -g
npm i react-script react-dom'
Once you have run those, you should be ready to build and work on the project
`npm run build` or `npm run start` for a production or test build
`npm run test` to check that the code still is working

## Credit Where Credit is Due
I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to help
bootstrap this program.
