# Search Algorithms Visualization
## What is this project for?
Search Algorithms Visualization is a basic project in react that shows how linear and binary search work upon an collection of values. While the algorithms involved are basic it mostly served to help me learn and practice good programming habits in a langauge that is still pretty new to me.
## How can I help?
Feel free to download the project and run it yourself to better understand React and the involved search algorithms. Feel free to make a pull request with any changes that you would think improve the project. 
## Getting it started
Make sure that you have the latest version of npm installed
`which npm > /dev/null || curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt install nodejs`
`sudo npm install npm@latest -g`
`npm i react-script react-dom`
Once you have run those, you should be ready to build and work on the project!
build creates a production ready set of files, start builds and creates a local
server, and test runs all of the tests.
`npm run build`
`npm run start`
`npm run test`
## Credit Where Credit is Due
I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to help
bootstrap this program.
